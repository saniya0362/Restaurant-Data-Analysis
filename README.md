# 🍽️ Restaurant Data Analysis  

This project is a **case study on restaurant orders data**, where I applied **SQL (MySQL)** for data extraction and analysis, and **Python (Pandas + Plotly)** for interactive visualizations.  
The goal was to answer **real-world business questions** that a restaurant manager might ask, such as:  

- What are the most popular menu items?  
- Which categories drive the most revenue?  
- When are the restaurant’s peak ordering hours?  
- How does weekly revenue grow or decline over time?  
- What is the average customer basket size?  

The project demonstrates an **end-to-end workflow**:  
from **writing queries in SQL**, connecting results to **Python for visualization**, and finally compiling insights into a **structured PDF report** suitable for stakeholders.

## 📌 What I Did  

1. Designed and executed **SQL queries** to answer 20+ business questions (easy → intermediate → advanced).  
2. Connected **MySQL to Python (Jupyter Notebook)** for further analysis and visualization.  
3. Processed results with **Pandas** and built **interactive charts using Plotly** (bar charts, line charts, heatmaps, etc.).  
4. Exported **query results with screenshots** and added clear headings for interpretation.  
5. Compiled everything into a **final PDF report** that merges both **SQL outputs and Python visuals** into one professional document.
